This piece is a acrylic on canvas done by the artist Jared Faulkner. This piece shows a deep blue background as a body water with a shadowy figure in the pool. This is meant to symbolize the fight or flight mentality except the artist portrays this inside a pool. You either sink to the bottom or keep swimming and pushing. For information on purchasing this piece contact Jared at jaredkfaulkner@gmail.com.
