![Why](/assets/why.jpg)
This piece is an acrylic on canvas done by Jared Faulkner. This is an abstract art piece therefore whatever meaning you get from this art is up to you. We can see a figure glaring at what seems to be a lonely rose chilling on a white background. Maybe the rose carries the white and represents good then the dark colors are used to represent danger in life. For information on this piece contact Jared at jaredkfaulkner@gmail.com.
