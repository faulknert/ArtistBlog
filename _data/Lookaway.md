This piece is an acrylic on canvas done by the artist Jared Faulkner. Much like the name of this piece Just Look The Other Way, this piece shows a dark and gloomy town up ahead with a hand pulling back a curtain to reveal the horror. Often times it is better to look the other way and move in a different direction. For information on purchasing this piece contact Jared at jaredkfaulkner@gmail.com
